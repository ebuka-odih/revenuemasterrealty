            information or content relating to investment strategies and opportunities to buy securities, you should not
            construe any such content as tax, legal, financial, or investment advice. You represent that any decision to

            investments involve a degree of risk, and you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for
            determining the suitability of an investment or strategy and accept the risks associated with such
            decisions, which may include the risk of complete loss of your principal. You agree and acknowledge that you

        <h3 class="nitro-offscreen">Consent to Electronic Communications, Transactions and Disclosures</h3>

            also consent to receive certain disclosures electronically, either via our Site or to the e-mail address you

            pay any amounts you have agreed to pay, and authorize DiversyFund to make all investment disbursements,
            using such account. You agree to provide DiversyFund updated information regarding your bank or other
            financial institution account upon DiversyFund’s request or at any time the information previously provided
            to us becomes invalid.</p>

            in which such IRS Form 1099 is made available. After that date the IRS Form 1099 may no longer be accessible
            electronically. We may discontinue electronic provision of Disclosures at any time in our sole
            discretion.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Telephone consent. You also expressly consent to receive calls and messages,
            including auto-dialed and pre-recorded message calls, and SMS messages (including text messages) from us and

                Policy</a>.&nbsp; You represent and warrant that you have reviewed the Privacy Policy and agree to its
            terms.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">You are not obligated by law to provide us personally identifying information.
            However, if you do not provide certain personally identifying information, you will not be able to use
            certain features of this Site.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">DiversyFund will also collect the names and email addresses of users who contact us
            through the Site with questions about DiversyFund. We collect this information for the sole purpose of
            responding to such inquiries and do not store the contact information unless requested to do so, as in the
            case of job applicants who submit resumes.&nbsp; Subject to the provisions of our Privacy Policy, any
            communication or material that you transmit to us through the Site, by electronic mail or otherwise,
            including any data, questions, comments, suggestions and the like, is and will be treated as
            non-confidential and non-proprietary information. We may use such communication or material for any purpose
            whatsoever including, without limitation, for disclosure, reproduction and publication. We will be free,
            without any compensation to you, to use any concepts or know-how contained in any communication or material
            that you send to our Site for any purpose whatsoever. In addition, we will be free to use any
            non-identifying statistical information relating to the Site or use thereof without any compensation to
            you.</p>
        <h2 class="nitro-offscreen">Notifications and Communications from Our Site</h2>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">By registering on the Site, you acknowledge and agree that we may send you email
            messages about our company, our Services and transactions. By accepting these Terms or using the Site or the
            Services, you affirmatively consent to receive such commercial messages. DiversyFund will send you email
            notifications from time to time. Some notifications are required elements of your transactions on our
            platform, such as confirmations of particular actions you have taken. These mandatory notices are sent
            typically to notify you of a change in status. For example, you will receive a notice when you are confirmed
            as an investor.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">We also send out notices that are required for legal or security purposes. For
            example, certain notifications are sent for your own protection to ensure that another person cannot make a
            change to your account without your knowledge. In other cases, these notifications involve changes to
            various legal agreements or Site policies. Generally, you may not opt out of such service-related
            emails.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">When you register as an investor, you will receive emails that confirm specific
            actions you requested. These will include emails to which you must respond to complete your registration and
            notifications confirming your registration. Thereafter, you will receive emails when a new investment
            opportunity is offered, as well as updates concerning the progress of the funding of such offering and/or
            other relevant information. If you make an investment through the Site, DiversyFund will also send you
            confirmations of the investment as well as occasional updates as to the status of that investment and the
            timing of distributions relating to that investment.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">We may also send you responses to emails you send us, if appropriate. From time to
            time, we will also send user surveys, requests for user feedback regarding user experience and Site
            operations, or marketing offers from us or from us on behalf of our marketing partners. Completing these
            surveys, answering requests for feedback, or accepting any offer is voluntary. If you do not wish to receive
            these surveys, user feedback emails, and/or marketing offers, please opt out in any offer email you receive
            from us.</p>
        <h2 class="nitro-offscreen">Information Updates</h2>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">You must keep us informed of any change in your email address, your home mailing

            theory of liability), shall DiversyFund, its officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries, or affiliated

            liability for consequential, incidental, or other damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you: in
            these jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Indemnification. You will indemnify and hold harmless DiversyFund, its affiliates,
            and any of their respective officers, directors, and employees from and against any and all damages,
            judgments, settlements, penalties, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) paid or incurred in

        <p class="nitro-offscreen"><b>Arbitration</b></p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Informal Negotiations. To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute,
            controversy or claim related to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
            validity thereof (“Dispute”), you and DiversyFund agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
            those Disputes expressly described below) informally for at least three) days before initiating any
            arbitration. Such informal negotiations will begin upon written notice from one person to the other. You
            should send your notice to DiversyFund, Symphony Tower, 750 B Street, Suite 1930 San Diego, CA 92101,
            ATTENTION: LEGAL DEPARTMENT.&nbsp; We will send our notice to your address as set forth in the books and
            records of the Company or by email to the email address provided by you in connection with your use of
            Services.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Binding Arbitration at Option of Either Party. If you and the Company are unable to
            resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or the Company may elect to have the Dispute
            (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by confidential binding
            arbitration, and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. Any election to
            arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION,
            YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and
            conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where
            appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both
            of which are available at the <a title="Link to adr.org" href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank"
                                             rel="noopener">AAA website</a>. The determination of whether a Dispute is
            subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The parties agree that the
            arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation,
            applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement. Your arbitration fees and your share
            of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA
            Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, the Company will pay all
            arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be conducted, at the option of the claimant, either in
            person or by video conference. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing but need not provide a
            statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award
            may be challenged within a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) if the arbitrator fails to do
            so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in court to compel
            arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the
            award entered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered and
            enforcement obtained thereon in any court having jurisdiction. All arbitration proceedings shall be closed
            to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be permanently sealed, except as
            necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. Each party shall have the right to
            participate by video conference in order to minimize travel and expense burdens. Subject to the section of
            this Agreement titled “Limitations of Liability; Disclaimers”, the arbitrator shall have authority to grant
            any form of appropriate relief, whether legal or equitable in nature, including specific performance.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">No Class Actions. You and the Company agree that any claim brought in connection with
            a Dispute, whether resolved through arbitration or not, will be brought between the Company and you
            individually, and that you may not assert any such claim against the Company as plaintiff or class member in
            any purported class or representative proceeding. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration
            shall be joined with any other; (2) no Dispute between you and the Company is to be arbitrated on a
            class-action basis or will utilize class action procedures; and (3) you may not bring any Dispute in a
            purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other users of the Services or any other
            persons. If this specific provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this titled
            “Arbitration” will be null and void.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration. You and the Company agree that
            the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
            arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or
            the Company’s intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.</p>
        <p class="nitro-offscreen">Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement
            related to its amendment blow, if the Company changes any of the terms of this section on “Arbitration’
            after the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Agreement), you
            may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by electronic mail to
            legal@diversyfund.com) within 30 days after the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last
            Updated” date herein or in the date of the Company’s email to you notifying you of such change (whichever is
            earlier. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and
            Company in accordance with the terms of this “Arbitration” section as of the date you first accepted the
            Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to the Agreement).</p>

            this Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless
            agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
            provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.</p>
